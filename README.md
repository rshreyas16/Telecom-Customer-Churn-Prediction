This project is about telecom churning.

Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry and it affects buisness.

This project is about predicting the Telecom churning using Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and by applying 
supervised Machine learning algorithm like Logistic Regression , Support vector machine and Random Forest algorithms.
This project will help us to understand what are the important factors affecting the churning.
